\section*{Abstract}

The Internet of Things is becoming a larger part of our world day by day. Big name companies often manufacture and develop devices with ease of use in mind, often sacrificing a lot of extensibility and hackability.

Shulker aims to be a software solution that does not sacrifice flexibility for ease of use. This allows for Do-It-Yourself enthusiasts and hackers alike to control access with maximum customizability and an easy to expand on system.

The finished project is a full-on solution providing a Smartphone-App, an API-Server, a fletched out Interface and a fully functioning showpiece.
